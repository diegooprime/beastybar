### Scope for simulator

* Edition: **Beasty Bar (base set, 2019 updated rules)**.
* Players: **2**.
* Scoring: **points per animal**; ties allowed. 

### Components

* Per player: 12‑card animal deck.
* Shared: Heaven’s Gate, Bounced, Beasty Bar, THAT’S IT; space for a 5‑card queue (“Jostling area”). 
* Bounced is only a marker for the back of the queue; expelled animals always go to THAT’S IT. 

### Setup

* Each player shuffles their 12 animals and draws **4**.
* Place Heaven’s Gate and Bounced with room for **5** cards between. Place Beasty Bar and THAT’S IT nearby. 

### Turn structure (always in this order)

1. **Play** one card at the **back** of the Jostling area.
2. **Execute** the played card’s **animal action**.
3. **Recurring actions**: process from **Gate → Bounced**. Recurring types: **Hippo, Crocodile, Giraffe**. **Zebra** is **permanent** (passive).
4. **Five‑animal check**: if exactly **5** animals now in line → the **front two** enter the bar face‑down; the **last** is bounced to THAT’S IT; the rest slide toward the gate.
5. **Draw** 1 (if deck non‑empty). 

### Animal actions (base set)

* **12 Lion**: If no lion in line, **scare all monkeys** to THAT’S IT, then move to **front**. If a lion is already present, the new lion goes **straight to THAT’S IT**. 
* **11 Hippo** (**recurring**): **Pass** all **weaker** animals toward the gate; **cannot pass zebras** or stronger. 
* **10 Crocodile** (**recurring**): **Eat** weaker animals **ahead** until blocked by a **≥ strength** animal or a **zebra**; eaten go to THAT’S IT. 
* **9 Snake**: **Sort** the entire line **by strength** descending; ties keep relative order. 
* **8 Giraffe** (**recurring**): **Jump** over **one** directly preceding **weaker** animal. Max **once per turn**. 
* **7 Zebra** (**permanent**): **Blocks** hippos from passing and crocs from passing/eating itself or anyone **in front of it**. Protection is continuous. 
* **6 Seal**: **Flip** the queue by swapping the Heaven’s Gate and Bounced markers; the entire line reverses order before recurring effects. 
* **5 Chameleon**: **Imitate** another species **present** this turn; take that species’ **strength** for the copied action **only**, then revert to **5** before any recurrences. 
* **4 Monkey**: If **two or more** monkeys are in line after play, **bounce all hippos and crocodiles**, then the **just‑played monkey** moves to **front**, gathering its monkey mates **behind it** in **reversed order**. A single monkey does nothing. 
* **3 Kangaroo**: **Jump** over the **last one or two** animals in line. 
* **2 Parrot**: **Bounce any one** animal in line to THAT’S IT (your choice). 
* **1 Skunk**: **Expel** all animals of the **highest** and **second‑highest** strengths currently in line (**skunks exempt**). 

### Five‑animal check, end, and scoring

* The check happens **after** all on‑play and recurring actions.
* Game ends after all cards are played.
* **Winner**: player with **most points** from animals in the Beasty Bar. **Ties possible**. 

### Official point values (base set)

* **2 points** each: **Lion 12, Hippo 11, Snake 9, Seal 6**.
* **3 points** each: **Crocodile 10, Giraffe 8, Chameleon 5, Monkey 4**.
* **4 points** each: **Zebra 7, Kangaroo 3, Parrot 2, Skunk 1**.

# Use with: ProgressiveMCTSSchedule.from_yaml("configs/mcts_schedule_example.yaml")

# ============================================================================
# Win Rate-Based Schedule (Recommended for most training)
# ============================================================================
# Scales simulations based on win rate milestones.
# Early training with weak value network uses fewer simulations.
# As win rate improves, more simulations help refine the policy.

mcts_schedule:
  type: "winrate"
  min_simulations: 100      # Start with 100 simulations
  max_simulations: 400      # Cap at 400 simulations
  milestones:
    0.50: 200               # At 50% WR: increase to 200 sims
    0.70: 400               # At 70% WR: increase to 400 sims
  use_peak_winrate: false   # Use current WR, not peak (more responsive)
  smoothing_window: 3       # Average last 3 evaluations for stability

# Alternative configurations (uncomment to use)

# ============================================================================
# Linear Schedule
# ============================================================================
# Gradually increases simulations over training iterations.
# Simple and predictable, good for fixed training budgets.

# mcts_schedule:
#   type: "linear"
#   min_simulations: 100
#   max_simulations: 400
#   total_iterations: 200
#   warmup_iterations: 10     # Stay at min for first 10 iters

# ============================================================================
# Step Schedule
# ============================================================================
# Discrete jumps at win rate thresholds.
# Includes hysteresis to prevent oscillation at boundaries.

# mcts_schedule:
#   type: "step"
#   min_simulations: 100
#   thresholds:
#     0.50: 200               # Jump to 200 at 50% WR
#     0.70: 400               # Jump to 400 at 70% WR
#   hysteresis: 0.02          # 2% margin to prevent oscillation
#   require_consecutive: 2    # Require 2 consecutive evals above threshold

# ============================================================================
# Exponential Schedule
# ============================================================================
# Slower initial growth, faster later growth.
# Good when early training needs stability.

# mcts_schedule:
#   type: "exponential"
#   min_simulations: 100
#   max_simulations: 400
#   total_iterations: 200
#   warmup_iterations: 20

---
# ============================================================================
# Cosine Schedule
# ============================================================================
# S-curve growth: slow start, fast middle, slow end.
# Smooth transitions throughout training.

# mcts_schedule:
#   type: "cosine"
#   min_simulations: 100
#   max_simulations: 400
#   total_iterations: 200
#   warmup_iterations: 10

---
# ============================================================================
# Aggressive Schedule (Fast Training)
# ============================================================================
# For quick experimentation with less compute.

# mcts_schedule:
#   type: "winrate"
#   min_simulations: 50
#   max_simulations: 200
#   milestones:
#     0.45: 100
#     0.55: 150
#     0.65: 200

---
# ============================================================================
# Conservative Schedule (Maximum Strength)
# ============================================================================
# For final training with maximum compute budget.

# mcts_schedule:
#   type: "winrate"
#   min_simulations: 200
#   max_simulations: 800
#   milestones:
#     0.60: 400
#     0.75: 600
#     0.85: 800
#   use_peak_winrate: true    # Don't decrease sims on bad evals
